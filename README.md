# @jtjs/theme

A theme library for JTJS components that lets you hit the ground running! Saves you time writing custom styles and provides styling for JTJS components that require styling (like the `Toggle`). 

Takes into consideration any theme coloring injected by the `ThemeService` found in `@jtjs/view`, should you be using that.

Recommended JTJS usage is to use this package as a base and override styles as needed for your desired look.

To use, simply install the package and include 
```css
@import '@jtjs/theme';
``` 
in your CSS.
